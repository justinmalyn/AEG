## Note to application reviewer
I created a new ProductCard component, which reads in a Product prop to receive all necessary info about the product. I set some additional styling to show a grow and slight dropshadow effect to the card on hover. I kept the add to cart redux functionality to manage the state of adding a product to the cart. I fixed up how the images were displaying a bit stretched, and made sure the column and row layouts were responsive for mobile viewing.
